Method and adaptive algorithms for biomedical signals
compression with guaranteed accuracy based on the second order
delta-transformations

* The method allows to compress ECG and EEG signals 4,5 ÷ 7,7 times with a guaranteed
  accuracy of 1 ÷ 5 mV (13 ÷ 10 bits of the original signal, which values of samples are in
  the range ~ [-4, +4] mV)
* The method provides high performance and high compression level
* The method is purposed to use in realtime for compression of nonstationar digital signals
* The algorithms is purposed and optimized for signal processors with integer calculations
- nonoptimized encoding of a single sample takes ~ 3000 processor tacts
- optimized encoding of a single sample takes ~ 150 processor tacts
- optimized decoding of a single sample takes ~ 90 processor tacks
